- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Altycon
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everything but one can only learn and know so much in any moment
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript. A few years ago I became very interested in Number Theory and came across John Conway's Surreal Numbers.
      Some how I ended up very interested in learning how computer programming worked. I'm very new to this but I inevitably what to know how 
      computers work, how we build them, and help to imagine and create whatever is next.
 - I have more ideas than I can make and most of my code will be bulky and confusing. I do not know most conventions.     
- If you must, you may reach me at anternidrummer@hotmail.com
